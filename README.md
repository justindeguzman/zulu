#Zulu

##Overview

Zulu is the address book re-imagined. We believe that the traditional address book where you view your contacts alphabetically and with no context is ill-suited for the modern world. Zulu allows you to instead define relationships between you and your contacts and organizes your address book by those relationships. Zulu also lets you easily search through your contacts by tags, so you can focus on people, not names.
